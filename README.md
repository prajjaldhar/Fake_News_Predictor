## FAKE_NEWS_PREDICTOR
### Machine Learning and Data Science Project

In this project, I have developed a machine learning model that predicts whether a news article is fake or not. The dataset used is from Kaggle website and I have used TFIDvectoriser along with some stopwords to preprocess the data. Through my exploration of the project, I found great joy in learning about the nltk model and its functionalities. I have also created a Flask app to give the machine learning model a website, making it more accessible to users. This project is just the beginning, and I am excited to continue developing and improving it. #MachineLearning #FakeNewsDetection #DataScience #Python #Flask #Nltk #Kaggle.
